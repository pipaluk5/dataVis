#what's the point of modelling?
#obtaining a simple low-dimensional summary of a dataset
# strong patterns might hide subtler ones

#two parts to a model
#1. define the family of models (e.g. linear, quadratic)
#2. generate a fitted model (e.g. y=3*x+7)
#this is just the closest model from a family of models. (might be bad and untrue)
#Box: all models are wrong but some are useful.
#goals: discover simple approximations that are useful

#the simulated dataset (sim1) contains two continuous variables
